week 8 class notes

int[] arr = {7, 5, 1, 3, 8, 2};

//looping directions(left to right)
//foward vs backwards(right to left)

//fowards
for (int i = 0; i <arr.length; i++){
	int element = arr[i];
}

//backwards
for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--){
	int element = arr[i];
}
//can i access an array of elements in reverse going backwards while looping forwards?
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
	int element = arr[arr.length-1-i];
}

//formula: i+want = lenght-1 (ultimatly tries to calc what want is.
//An idea to loop fowards and access elemnts going backwards is length-1-i

//reverse an array ex {2, 8, 3, 1, 4, 7}
//perform SWAP by coding(not using util)
int temp = arr[pos1];
arr[pos1] = arr[pos2];
arr[pos2]=temp;

//selection sort
	//find smallest number
	//swap it to the front
//Cocktail Shaker Sort(looks for min and max going forwards and backwards)
