week 10 notes

properties, characteristics, behaviors-> can do things with an object.
strings are objects(what are the behaviors?) are typaclly methods
using variables, methods and strings we create objects
from single class we create objects. class defines properties charateristics of objects. when we create an objects we create values. 
when creating a class we create the object when we create the objeacte we create the properties.
what are some properties of books? maybe a title. Has pageses. we can make multiple object from one class.
typically objects don't have main methods. they start with preperties:access modifyers (public/private)data type(string int double)name(title author)
then we put in a constructor. below construcotrs we put behaviors or methods. these methods do NOT have static. we jump right into return type, method names the perameters.
from there methods usually work the same.
