Oregon Trail HW notes

how to go from hw to code? Start with objects.

public class Traveler {
	//properties
	//name, food, isHealthy
	
	//constructors-two of them
	//the job of a constructor:
		//initialize properties
	
	
	//class methods

	//getter
	public varType getVarName(){
		return varName;
	}
	
	//setters
	public void setVarName(varType varName){
		this.varName = varName;
	}
	
	public void hunt/eat(){
		//do the thing...

		//takes a point away from food
		food = food - 1;
		or food--;
		food -= 1;
		//if the food is not zero
		if(food > 0)
		//if no food-> health deteriorates
		if (food = 0){
			isHealthy = false;
		}
	}
